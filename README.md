<b>v.3.0.6</b>

Debian 10 fix for Debian 10

### How do I get set up? ###

Follow one of the above guides to install a fresh copy of a supported Linux distribution.

Run the following command as root user:

* Debian/Raspbian 7, 8, 9 and 10 and Ubuntu 14.04, 15.10, 16.04, 16.10 and 18.04

```shell
cd /tmp; wget -O installer.tgz "https://github.com/servisys/ispconfig_setup/tarball/master"; tar zxvf installer.tgz; cd *ispconfig*; bash install.sh
```
* CentOS 7

```shell
cd /tmp; sudo yum install wget unzip net-tools; wget -O installer.tgz "https://github.com/servisys/ispconfig_setup/tarball/master"; tar zxvf installer.tgz; cd *ispconfig*; sudo install.sh
```

CentOS 7 is in a very early stage, we got to test a bit, any help will be appreciated.
Some features are missing for now, only implemented Apache and Dovecot, no webmail.

If `wget` fails, try adding the `--no-check-certificate` parameter.

Follow the instructions on the screen
